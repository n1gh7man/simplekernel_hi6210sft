config CPU_FREQ
	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	help
	  CPU Frequency scaling allows you to change the clock speed of 
	  CPUs on the fly. This is a nice method to save power, because 
	  the lower the CPU clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

	  Note that this driver doesn't automatically change the CPU
	  clock speed, you need to either enable a dynamic cpufreq governor
	  (see below) after boot, or use a userspace tool.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

	  'conservative' - this driver is rather similar to the 'ondemand'
	  governor both in its source code and its purpose, the difference is
	  its optimisation for better suitability in a battery powered
	  environment.  The frequency is gracefully increased and decreased
	  rather than jumping to 100% when speed is required.

	  If you have a desktop machine then you should really be considering
	  the 'ondemand' governor instead, however if you are using a laptop,
	  PDA or even an AMD64 based computer (due to the unacceptable
	  step-by-step latency issues between the minimum and maximum frequency
	  transitions in the CPU) you will probably want to use this governor.

config CPU_FREQ_GOV_LIONFISH
	tristate "'lionfish' governor"
	depends on CPU_FREQ
	help
	  'lionfish' - this is an improved version of the conservative governor
	  that is optimized for smartphones. To avoid lag, it quickly jumps
	  to an intermediate frequency when high load is encountered at low
	  frequencies. If very high load is encountered above this intermediate
	  frequency, it jumps to a high frequency. For moderate loads, it
	  votes to increase, decrease, or maintain frequencies at each sampling
	  interval. When enough votes are gathered to raise or lower the
	  frequency, the frequency is changed. This mechanism reduces jitter
	  compared to the conservative governor. Lionfish uses proportional
	  ramping to more quickly reach suitable frequencies compared to the
	  conservative governor. By default, Lionfish also reduces frequencies
	  more aggressively than the conservative governor when loads are reduced.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called cpufreq_lionfish.
